## About

Just a simple storybook example. This is me checking out [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). This is just a button with a few differing styles.

You can load up the mostly defualt react app and see a terrible looking button was added.

Loading up storybook shows the same button component but isolated from the rest of the app.

in /components editing the style.css will change the button for the story and the one in App.js


## Use

`git clone`

`yarn install`

`yarn start` for react

`yarn run storybook` to start storybook
