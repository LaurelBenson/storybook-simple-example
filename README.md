## About

Just a simple Storybook example. This is me checking out [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). This is just a button with a few differing styles.

You can load up the mostly default React app and see a terrible looking button was added.

Loading up Storybook shows the same button component but isolated from the rest of the app.

Editing `components/style.css` will change the button for the story and the one in `App.js`.

## Use

`git clone`

`yarn install`

`yarn start` for react

`yarn run storybook` to start storybook
